'''Module containing decoders for different websited

This module contains decoders for decoding information from
various websites. Any new website that needs to be added
will contain information about how a particular website is to 
be decoded over here. You should include modules here as they
become important.

The functions within the files over here take an HTML encoded
string, and return a dictionary. This form is particularly
convinient because this can be generalized in any way required.

Currently the following decoders are present:

| module | website                |
|--------|------------------------|
| drugs  | https://www.drugs.com  |
